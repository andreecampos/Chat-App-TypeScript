# Description

Each user must first create an account with a username and email. The password is securely managed.

Every message sent must save information about the sender (name), the text of the message, and the time and date it was sent. All messages must be displayed in chronological order where the sender, the text, and the time and date are clearly displayed. Each message should be updated automatically.

The project can be run locally using Docker. This means that the frontend, backend, and database should be run in separate docker instances.
